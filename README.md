# [WIP] Auto Deeplab in PyTorch 

This is a PyTorch implementation of the architecture found by the Hierarchical Neural Architecture Search introduced in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02985v1

TODO:
- [x]  Cell architecture
- [ ]  Module architecture
- [ ]  Evaluation in TensorBoard
- [ ]  Training with SURREAL
